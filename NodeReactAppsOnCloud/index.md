### WEEK 3 Express Web Application Framework

When you use Node.js to build a hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) server, you will discover that the default Node.js framework is low level. You can extend its features with third-party packages. Get hands-on experience by using the Express web application framework. Discover how to manage package dependencies. Create a web server that listens to incoming requests. Use routing, middleware, and template rendering to extend the Node.js framework and handle dynamic content.

### WEEK 4 Building a Rich Front-End Application using REACT & ES6

As you are becoming more proficient with JavaScript, you will find that it is a very dynamic language and looks different than the typical object-oriented languages. Now you will discover new features that make developing simpler and faster than older JavaScript capabilities. Explore how to access the React web framework user interface (UI) library and run a simple React application. Find ways to use React components and change their properties and states in a dynamic UI. You will use what you know about asynchronous calls to connect React to an external server.
